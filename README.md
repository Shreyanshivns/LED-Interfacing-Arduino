# ðŸ”Œ LED Chaser using Arduino

This project demonstrates a basic **LED chasing effect** using an Arduino board. Five LEDs connected to pins 2 through 6 light up one after another with a short delay, creating a simple sequential blinking pattern.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Overview

- **Language**: C++
- **Platform**: Arduino (Tinkercad compatible)
- **Components Used**:
  - Arduino Uno
  - 5 LEDs
  - 5 Resistors (220Î©)
  - Jumper Wires
  - Breadboard

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- All LEDs are set as OUTPUT pins in the `setup()` function.
- In the `loop()`, each LED is turned ON and OFF sequentially using a `for` loop and a 200 ms delay between each state change.
- This creates a "chasing" or "running light" effect.
